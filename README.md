# Who I am
Hey, I'm Jake Young

Below you'll find an overview of who I am, what I do, and a list of helpful resources for general productivity, programming, and project management. 

# What I do

ðŸŽž My background is in TV and film production. I love a good movie. ðŸ¤“ I love finding solutions to problems. When I'm not programming you can find me skiing â›·or trying my hand at home renovation .ðŸ”¨ 

My goal is to work on great projects with great people. I'm passionate about creating easy to use products that save people time and pride myself on the ability to rapidly try out new ideas and develop corresponding product pipelines.

But Jake, how did you go from a film person to a software engineer? Great question, so glad you asked. Videos need a place to live, like a website or an app. You're also always looking to shave off time when preparing videos for apps and websites. Encoding video is hard and technical. Streaming protocols, exporting with command line tools, understanding the pipeline, and finding time savers takes you to a lot of places. I fell in love with building apps and tools along the way.

# Experience

- 15 years of iOS, Mac, and Web Development.
- 8 years of Swift development. I've been here the whole time.
- 15 years of Objective-C development.
- I bounce between customer facing apps and backend tooling.

# Current Work

I make the Rue and Gilt Apps for iOS at Rue Gilt Groupe.

# Previous Work Experience

I lead product development and IT infrastructure at [ACP Decisions](https://acpdecisions.org). We have [a large library of videos and guides](https://acpdecisions.org/library/) (250+) in over 20 languages that help patients make informed medical decisions (250+). I am the lead developer of our iOS app, and oversee the product development for our web services. Some of the largest healthcare networks utilize this content and our platform to ensure that patients are empowered with essential information to make informed medical decisions.

- Creating internal tools to maximize the effectiveness of our team (multiple iOS and Mac apps, web based dashboards for key stake holders, and many more)

# Technology Skillset

The higher up on the list, the better I know it. I've been in jobs where resources were extremely constrained, forcing me to learn something new, and deliver something quickly. Each of these technologies got me there. Could I write you a working PHP app tomorrow? I'm probably a little rusty.
